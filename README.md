# Sholazar

Sholazar is a tool for building Epsilon phases and geometry. It aspires to be a full-fledged editor one day.

## FAQ

### What's the origin of the name?

Located in Northrend, the Sholazar Basin is an area where the Titans created lifeforms. Since this is also a tool
for creation, it felt like an appropriate name, though I might change it eventually.
